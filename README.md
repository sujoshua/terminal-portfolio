My homepage in terminal style developed with Vue3, TypeScript. Multiple themes, keyboard shortcuts and i18n are supported.

## 🙏 Acknowledgement

This project is based on [satnaing/terminal-portfolio](https://github.com/satnaing/terminal-portfolio), originally developed by satnaing, and built using React. I have reimagined it using Vue, with much of the original CSS and theme retained.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the original author for brilliant creativity and hard work, which served as the inspiration and foundation for this project.
